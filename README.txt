Hello! It's quadratic_equation - library to calculate roots of quadratic equations.


! This project using CMake to compile. You need CMake version 2.8.12 or higher to compile that


Commands:
Use "make compile" to build library.
Use "make check" to build library and tests, running tests and get testing report in console.
Use "make clean" to remove all builded files. You can build library and tests again.


Connect this library to your project and use function solve_equation(a,b,c) to solve equation ax^2+bx+c=0.
Example of project using this library you can find in directory "example"


More information about library you can get from info.txt
